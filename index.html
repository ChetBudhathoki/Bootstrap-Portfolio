      <p>Hi Everyone!</p>
      <p>My name is Chet Budhathoki. I was born and raised in Nepal. If you still confused what/where is Nepal, let me give you a quick reminder. This is a country of Mount Everest and it lies between to huge countries India and China. Grew up in a small town in Nepal and moved to South Korea when I was 21 years old. I lived there almost a decade prior immigrating to the United States during the recession 2010. I guess, it's been almost a decade since I arrived in the United States. Because I lived in couple countries, I speak 4 languages including my native language Nepali, Hindi, Korean, and English. 
      </p>
      <br>
        <p> I found out that I was good at running in my late 30s. After running my first 5K in 34 minutes, I decided to improve my running to run a Boston Marathon. With a year and half training in running, I qualified for Boston and ran 123rd Boston Marathon this year 2019. I will be running Chicago and New York marathon this year which I qualified for both of them. Well, it's just too much about running, let's change a topic. 
        </p>
      <br>
        <p> I always fascinated with computer and technology ever since I
        started
        learning computer. Information technology was very foreign to me growing up. There were literally
        handful of
        people who knew how to operate computer let alone Web Development.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Even though I was interested in computer and IT stuffs, I never took any formal classes. I kept teaching
        myself about hardware, software, and the market trend. Instead of finding my strength in software development, I ended up getting my undergraduate and graduate degree in Sociology major and Population study minor. After achieving Master's degree in Sociology, I realized that this academic degree definitely taught me to understand people and society. The cultural differences and variations. However, this is technically not helping me to fulfill my daily needs. Therefore, I decided to take this course to improve my career. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Now,
        looking at my interest and the job market, I thought going into IT would definitely make sence.
        Especially
        becoming a Web Developer has a great scope in the job market. Going to school in middle age is kind of
        hard.Obviously this is a continuously evolving sector. Keep learning and keep growing is my mantra and
        someday I will get there where I wanted to be.
        </p>
