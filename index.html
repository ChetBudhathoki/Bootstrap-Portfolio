            <p>Hi Everyone!</p>
            <p>My name is Chet Budhathoki. I was always fascinated with computer and technology ever since I
            started
            learning computer. Information technology was very foreign to me growing up. There were literally
            handful of
            people who knew how to operate computer let alone Web Development.</p>
            <p>Even though I was interested in computer and IT stuffs, I never too any formal classes. I kept teaching
            myself about hardware, software, and the market trend. Now,
            looking at my interest and the job market, I thought going into IT would definitely make sence.
            Especially
            becoming a Web Developer has a great scope in the job market. Going to school in middle age is kind of
            hard. I have spent several days and hours for this project and still not perfect and I'm myself not
            happy with what I've built.</p>
            <p>Obviously this is a continuously evolving sector. Keep learning and keep growing is my mantra and
            someday I will get there where I wanted to be.</p>
